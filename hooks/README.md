# Hooks — keeping the axes present

The Codex only works if it's *in context* when the agent acts. A one-time paste into
`AGENTS.md` works; a hook makes it automatic, every session, and opens each run under
blessing.

## `session-start.sh`

Emits, to stdout:

1. The **Blessing of Saint Benedict** + the rotating verbum of the day (`bin/blessing`).
2. The **conduct block** — the four axes, precedence, and the gate limit (`codex-block.md`).

It's harness-agnostic: any harness that can run a command at session start can use it, and
its stdout is plain readable text.

## Wiring it into Claude Code

Claude Code injects a `SessionStart` hook's stdout into the session context. Add to your
`settings.json` (use the **absolute** path to the script, and check your Claude Code
version's hook docs — the schema evolves):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "/abs/path/to/angelical-harness/hooks/session-start.sh" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Wiring it into any other harness

Run `hooks/session-start.sh` as the first step of your session bootstrap and prepend its
output to the system prompt (or your context-priming step). That's all — the blessing goes
first, the axes stay present.
